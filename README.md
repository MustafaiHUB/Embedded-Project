# Embedded-Project
In this project, we are required to implement a program that centers a car exactly in between two obstacles (e.g. walls). We suppose two obstacles are separated by 100cm. We can place the car anywhere in between, but eventually it will drive itself to the middle point (50cm) such that it is equidistant (the same distance) from both walls. We used the PIC16F877a controller to read the sensors and drive the system. The simulated system has one DC motor to simulate the wheels (one motor for all four wheels). The wheels can go clockwise or counterclockwise (that is; the car will only move forwards or backwards, no turns). The system uses two ultrasonic sensors, one at the front, the other at the back of the car model and pointing away from each other. Each ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the car to the opposing obstacle (wall). We assumed in simulation that when the car is located in the middle, each ultrasonic sensor will have the value of 50. We were asked to not consider the car dimensions or the space in between the two sensors for simplicity.
